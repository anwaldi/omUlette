#I am very much not happy about this. I tried complaining, but apparently my complaints fell on deaf ears.
#If someone happens to see this, know that it was not my desire for this add-on to be anything but MIT license.
#But blender thinks it's fine to force you into sharing ALL of your code.
#I tried to explain *exactly* why the MIT license is better for game developers, but the representitive I was emailing just couldn't get it.
